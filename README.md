# StreamGuide

<h2>A TV guide that displays all the shows you can currently stream from any streaming app, all displayed in one place. </h2>

<h3>StreamGuide helps solves the problem of having TOO MANY APPS to stream television shows. Even Roku and Apple TV collect various apps the user needs to jump between. Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon all create their own original programing and networks are now developing their own apps. With StreamGuide, users can browse all available shows, then jump into the app after, instead of vice versa. (Currently in Pre-Alpha)</h3>

<p>The app pulls data from GuideBox, an API that collects data from various tv networks and streaming services. Calls are made using Retrofit. All the shows are displayed in a grid layout. The available networks are scrollable using a horizontal Recycler View. </p>


<p>
There is a detail activity that shows all shows from a network, and another detail activity that displays each episode of that series.
